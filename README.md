tiny_paginate is a lightweight and easy-to-use pagination gem for Ruby on Rails. Designed for simplicity and minimal overhead, it provides basic pagination functionality with clean helpers and minimal configurationâ€”perfect for small projects or developers who want to avoid the complexity of larger pagination libraries.

## Usage
`tiny_paginate` is simple to use. Follow the steps below to install and use it.

### Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "tiny_paginate"
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install tiny_paginate
```
To work with this gem in your application, execute the following command:

```

#### Modify controller
Here, we'll add the following line to setup page instance variable and extract portion of the records:
 
```
@recordings = set_page_and_extract_portion_from(collection: Recording.all)
```
`set_page_and_extract_partion` returns records and also @page instance variable which is available to the views

#### Modify the view
In the page where you want to display the records, paste the following entries, assumming that you have a model called recording:
```
<p>
  <%= link_to("Previous Page", recordings_path(page: @page.previous_page)) unless @page.first_page? %>
  <%= link_to("Next Page", recordings_path(page: @page.next_page)) unless @page.last_page? %>
</p>  
```

After installation, you can use the most recent version of `tiny_paginate` by running the following commands:
```bash
$ bundle update --conservative tiny_paginate
```
and then execute:`
```bash
$ rails g tiny_paginate:install
```
Continue to update the controller and view if you've not done so already.
